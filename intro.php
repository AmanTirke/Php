    <h2>Introduction to PHP</h2>
    <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language specifically designed for web development. PHP can be embedded within HTML, making it easy for beginners to learn and use. PHP scripts are executed on the server, allowing dynamic content generation before the page is sent to the user's browser.</p>
    <p>PHP was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf and has since evolved into a powerful, open-source programming language widely used for creating websites and web applications.</p>
